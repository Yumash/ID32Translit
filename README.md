# ID3 2 Translit

Inspired by Skoda Bolero device <2013 year. 
Bolero cannot read cyrillic ID3 so i decided to sketch a tiny tool to have an ability to read the track titles at least with translit.

If you want more to do with ID3 tags - you could use the *TagScanner* (http://www.xdlab.ru/). ID32Translit should be used only to transliterate cyrillic tags (Title, Artist, Album).
